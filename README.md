# Episerver CMS Environment Synchronizer
Ensures that content and settings that are stored in the databases are corrected given the current environment. This is helpful after a content synchronization between different Episerver environments.  
When synchronizing databases between environments there might be things that needs to be configured for each environment.
This addon provides the infrastructure to add handlers to handle this, including prebuilt handlers for siteDefinitions and ScheduledJobs that can be configured in configuration files (a.k.a. web.config)
